# Implementing Uninformed search - BFS, DFS and informed search - Simulated Annehealing for a tweaked version for the N-Queen problem. #

You will write a program that will take an input file that has an arrangement of trees and will output a new arrangement of lizards (and trees; as already mentioned, you canâ€™t move the trees) such that no baby lizard can eat another one. You will be required to create a program that finds the solution. To find the solution you will use the following algorithms:
- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Simulated annealing (SA).


Input: The file input.txt in the current directory of your program will be formatted as follows:
First line: Second line: Third line: Next n lines: instruction of which algorithm to use: BFS, DFS or SA strictly positive 32-bit integer n, the width and height of the square nursery strictly positive 32-bit integer p, the number of baby lizards
the n x n nursery, one file line per nursery row (to show you where the trees are). It will have a 0 where there is nothing, and a 2 where there is a tree.
So for instance, an input file arranged like figure 2B (but with no lizards yet) and requesting you to use the DFS algorithm to place 8 lizards in the 8x8 nursery would look like:

DFS
8
8 
00000000 
00000000 
00000000 
00002000 
00000000 
00000200 
00000000 
00000000


Output: The file output.txt which your program creates in the current directory should be formatted as follows:
First line: OK or FAIL, indicating whether a solution was found or not. If FAIL, any following lines are ignored. Next n lines: the n x n nursery, one line in the file per nursery row, including the baby lizards and trees. It will have a 0 where there is nothing, a 1 where you placed a baby lizard, and a 2 where there is a tree.
For example, a correct output.txt for the above sample input.txt (and matching Figure 2B) is:

OK 
00000100 
10000000 
00001000 
01002001 
00000000 
00100200 
00000010 
00010000

Example 1:
For this input.txt:
BFS 
2

one possible correct output.txt is:
FAIL


Example 2:
For this input.txt:

one possible correct output.txt is:

Example 3:
For this input.txt (same layout of trees as in Figure 2B, but we now want to place 9 lizards in this 8x8 nursery with 2 trees):
SA

one possible correct output.txt is:

01002001
